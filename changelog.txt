v1.1x   - (tba)
        - FIXED: 

v1.15   - (September 17, 2023)
        - FIXED: Minor bug fix preventing a new install from getting into setup! So much for optimizations! :) Thanks
          much to @visortgw for the catch!

v1.14   - (September 17, 2023)
        - MAJOR: Added an auto-purge feature! Based on the existing purge feature from the operations section under the
          setup menu, when calling "sh backupmon.sh -purge", it will use the purge settings you have configured to trim
          your perpetual backups without any user input. You can utilize this switch in conjunction with a daily CRON job
          to keep your backups trimmed.
        - ADDED: Thanks to @visortgw, added functionality to bypass the 10 second initial timer when using the -backup
          switch. If BACKUPMON is called without switches, it will use the 10 second timer.
        - MINOR: General improvements to visual spacing, messaging and logging.

v1.12   - (September 16, 2023)
        - FIXED: You guys are getting a BOGO today. Thanks to @ColinTaylor for the recommendation to immediately force a 
          reboot after restoring the NVRAM.cfg file, instead of prompting the user to choose y/n. I agree... this should
          be done immediately after, just like when restoring NVRAM from the UI.
        - ADDED: Good suggestion from @maghuro to check to make sure the source/target routers are the same, so that
          people aren't trying to restore an RT-AC86U backup onto a GT-AX6000, thinking this is all fine and all. Added
          some logic in there that captures router model and saves it to your config, and will compare that to the router
          model when you start a restore. This is the best attempt I can come up with to prevent people from bricking
          their router, and a last stop-gap measure to prevent a restore from doing potential damage. Please make sure you
          save a fresh copy of your configs as this value will need to be written before a restore can happen.

v1.1    - (September 16, 2023)
        - MAJOR: Many thanks to @maghuro and @ColinTaylor for their advice on NVRAM backups! BACKUPMON will now not only
          take backups of JFFS, your external USB drive, but also NVRAM! These 3 backups are stored under each of your
          daily folders. In case of a restore, these snapshots will work in concert together to bring your router back to
          its exact same state as before, settings and ALL!
        - FIXED: Some minor instruction verbiage changes in the restore instructions, as I blew away my old AC86U during
          the testing process of getting it restored back to a previous state with BACKUPMON. 

v1.02   - (September 15, 2023)
        - ADDED: Thanks to @maghuro and @alan6854321 for the suggestion to include a copy of the NVRAM settings. Please
          note... this extract is for reference purposes only, and cannot be used to import old NVRAM values back into
          your router. The 'nvram.txt' file is now included with the other assortment of files that are exported into
          the root of your external backup folder.
        - FIXED: Thanks to @maghuro for finding the typo in the config for the username/password labels.

v1.0    - (September 14, 2023)
        - RELEASE:  I'm satisfied... let's go live!

v0.92RC - (September 12, 2023)
        - FIXED: Issue where when backupmon was newly downloaded and installed, the setup menu would be going through a
          loop because it was referencing that the .cfg file was not found, and telling you to run setup. All fixed!

v0.91RC - (September 10, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality to help purge perpetual backups, with much thanks to @Martinski for supplying a
          great function to help with this! Under the config menu, when selecting "perpetual" backup frequency, you will
          have the option to choose whether you want to enable backup purging for everything older than a certain number
          of days. Once configured, you can access the purge backups functionality under the operations area under the
          setup menu. This function will step you through multiple prompts before committing to delete any backups, and
          will show you which backups are affected. PLEASE NOTE: deleting backups is permanent, and advise caution on what
          you are deleting, and ensure that the list presented to you is what you want deleted. Also, PLEASE NOTE: if there
          are any backups that you want to save or store for later use, PLEASE move these to a SAFE and otherwise secure
          location outside of the backup folder structure that BACKUPMON utilizes, else there will be a chance these
          backups will get deleted. I will be keeping the purge backups utility manual for the time being, giving you more
          control over when and what gets deleted. I may automate this in the future depending on demand.
        - RELEASE CANDIDATE: This completes all work for the release candidate. I will be taking another week to thoroughly
          test all functionality before releasing v1.0! 

v0.9RC  - (September 9, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality was added to give you an additional backup frequency choice... So in addition to
          weekly, monthly and yearly backup frequencies, you will now have a 'perpetual' option. (Thanks to @Stephen
          Harrington for the suggestion!) In this mode, instead of a Mon-Fri, 01-31 or 001-365 folder being created for the
          weekly, monthly or yearly backup frequencies, a unique folder based on date/time is created when the backup runs.
          For example: 20230909-092021. In this mode, only BASIC mode backups are allowed, which provide for a simpler
          naming convention, and easier restoration process. When using the 'perpetual frequency' option under BASIC mode,
          backups are not pruned, nor are they overwritten if multiple backups are taken on the same day. In this case, a
          new, uniquely named backup folder is created each time.

v0.8RC  - (September 8, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality to choose between the mode of BACKUPMON: Basic or Advanced. Here is the difference
          between this functionality (formally called, @Stephen Harrington Mode) <tongue-in-cheek>:

              BASIC
              - Only backs up one backup set per daily folder
              - Backup file names have standard names based on jffs and USB drive label names
              - Self-prunes the daily backup folders by deleting contents before backing up new set
              - Will overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day
              - Restore more automated, and only required to pick which day to restore from

              ADVANCED
              - Backs up multiple daily backup sets per daily folder
              - Backup file names contain extra unique date and time identifiers
              - Keeps all daily backups forever, and no longer self-prunes
              - Will not overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day
              - Restore more tedious, and required to type exact backup file names before restore

          Please note, that during a restore in advanced mode, you will be able to see the files under the directories
          you specify, but you will be required to enter in the EXACT full filename of the JFFS and USB backup filenames
          you wish to have restored. 

        - ADDED: New menu items under the setup menu, allow you to launch a backup or restore. Thanks to @Kingp!n for the
          suggestion!

v0.7RC  - (September 7, 2023)
        - FIXED: Added logic to watch for mount/umount failures, and will keep trying to mount or dismount for up to 2 minutes
          before giving up due to a failure. The error will be written to the syslog.

v0.6RC  - (September 5, 2023)
        - ADDED: Ability to set a scheduled daily CRON job with the time of your choice. This function will create the 
          necessary cru statement in your /jffs/scripts/service-start file, and add it to CRON as well. Unselecting this
          choice will remove it from both CRON and the service-start file. This item can be configured under the config
          menu, item #7.
        - ADDED: Ability to choose between 3 different backup frequency strategies. You get to choose between cycling through
          a week, a month, or a year. The week selection, it will create folders from Mon - Sun.  With the month (standard), 
          it creates folder from day 01 through day 31... and with the year, day 001 all the way through day 365. You better
          be prepared to allocate some space. ;)  You can pick your backup frequency under the config menu, item #8.
        - FIXED: Based on some feedback, I reworked the way modprobe is being used. No longer using the build of the FW as a
          and indicator, but as Jeff suggested, just seeing if the file exists, and if it does, use it. 

v0.5RC  - (September 4, 2023)
        - RELEASE: First release candidate of BACKUPMON! After some extensive backup and restoration testing, I believe it's
          ready for the masses to try out! :)
