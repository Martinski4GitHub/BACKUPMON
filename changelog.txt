v0.8RC - (September 8, 2023)
       - ADDED: New functionality to choose between the mode of BACKUPMON: Basic or Advanced. Here is the difference between
         this functionality (formally called, @Stephen Harrington Mode) <tongue-in-cheek>:

              BASIC
              - Only backs up one backup set per daily folder
              - Backup file names have standard names based on jffs and USB drive label names
              - Self-prunes the daily backup folders by deleting contents before backing up new set
              - Will overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day
              - Restore more automated, and only required to pick which day to restore from

              ADVANCED
              - Backs up multiple daily backup sets per daily folder"
              - Backup file names contain extra unique date and time identifiers"
              - Keeps all daily backups forever, and no longer self-prunes"
              - Will not overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day"
              - Restore more tedious, and required to type exact backup file names before restore"


v0.7RC - (September 7, 2023)
       - FIXED: Added logic to watch for mount/umount failures, and will keep trying to mount or dismount for up to 2 minutes
         before giving up due to a failure. The error will be written to the syslog.

v0.6RC - (September 5, 2023)
       - ADDED: Ability to set a scheduled daily CRON job with the time of your choice. This function will create the 
         necessary cru statement in your /jffs/scripts/service-start file, and add it to CRON as well. Unselecting this
         choice will remove it from both CRON and the service-start file. This item can be configured under the config
         menu, item #7.
       - ADDED: Ability to choose between 3 different backup frequency strategies. You get to choose between cycling through
         a week, a month, or a year. The week selection, it will create folders from Mon - Sun.  With the month (standard), 
         it creates folder from day 01 through day 31... and with the year, day 001 all the way through day 365. You better
         be prepared to allocate some space. ;)  You can pick your backup frequency under the config menu, item #8.
       - FIXED: Based on some feedback, I reworked the way modprobe is being used. No longer using the build of the FW as a
         and indicator, but as Jeff suggested, just seeing if the file exists, and if it does, use it. 

v0.5RC - (September 4, 2023)
       - RELEASE: First release candidate of BACKUPMON! After some extensive backup and restoration testing, I believe it's
         ready for the masses to try out! :)
