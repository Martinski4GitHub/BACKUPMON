* Add other info to the text file... like router model, firmware version...
* Possibly do a check of old/current firmware version and warn before a restore (like router model)
* Add a ping test to the network connection tester
* A connection tester functionality to test backup target username/pwd/paths for a successful connection
* Allow for multiple configs to perform redundant backups to multiple targets
