-----------------------------
* Option to add the -backup switch to the cron job

* Capture network target type (network or USB) to determine if an unmount needs to be run

In Progress:
------------

Completed:
----------
* Add support to allow user to chose which device they want backed up... sda1 = default
* Make it so that the purge doesn't have the backupmon headers, unless you run it from the config menu
* Add other info to the text file... like router model, firmware version...
* Possibly do a check of old/current firmware version and warn before a restore (like router model)
* Add a ping test to the network connection tester
* A connection tester functionality to test backup target username/pwd/paths for a successful connection
* Allow for multiple configs to perform redundant backups to multiple targets
* Allow for automated purging
* Allow choice between doing backups in 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year cycles
* Schedule a regular backup event in CRON
